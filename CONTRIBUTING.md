decision about merging rests with the website maintainers.

## Content Policy

The purpose of the website is to be an official mouthpiece for the Bitcoin Core project as well as be a resource for technical information
that has a direct impact on Bitcoin Core software. This can include research, presentations, and developer blogs. 

Where proposed content is about Bitcoin Core project policy, there should rough consensus of the Bitcoin Core project maintainers as a minimum bar
and final decision is with the Bitcoin Core project lead.

## Translations

occasion the English text is updated. Translated text should remove `translated: false` from the Front Matter.
