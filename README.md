#bitcoincore.org [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-core/website.svg?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/bitcoin-core/website)

This repository is the source code of the Bitcoin Core project website built with Jekyll.

## Directory structure

  - `_posts/<lang>/posts` for blog articles.
  - `_posts/<lang>/pages` for static pages.
  - `_posts/<lang>/releases` for Bitcoin Core release notes

File names *must* be in the format `Y-m-d-title.md`, e.g. `2015-12-31-title.md`. File names can be translated.

## Translations

Menu and miscellaneous translations can be found in:

  - `_data/lanaguges.yml`
  - `_data/navgation.yml`
  - `_data/translations.yml`
  
## Front Matter notes

The following `Front Matter` is required for the multilingual setup in all files. The required fields are as follows:

  - `name:`      group name for unique article. Each translation must share the same group name, e.g. `october15-report`
  - `id:`        each article translation must have a unique ID. Use the language code + `-name` field. e.g. `en-october15-report`
  - `permalink:` the ML permalink must include the language code, e.g. `/en/2015/12/31/report`. Permalinks should be translated.
  - `title:`     the translated title of the article

    bundle install
    
To preview the site (this will launch a tiny webserver on port 4000):

    bundle exec jekyll server

To simply build the site (output placed in the `_site` directory):

    bundle exec jekyll build
    
To test the site:
