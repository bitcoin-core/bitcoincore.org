## Building

This website is based on Jekyll. To build locally, [install Ruby 2.2.2](https://gorails.com/setup) or greater
and then run the following commands:

    gem install bundle
    bundle install

To preview the site (this will launch a tiny webserver on port 4000):

    bundle exec jekyll server --future

To simply build the site (output placed in the `_site` directory):

    bundle exec jekyll build --future

Note that the `--future` parameter is only required if you're adding any
pages dated in the future (such as prepared release announcements).

To test the site:

    bundle exec jekyll build --future --drafts --unpublished && bundle exec htmlproof ./_site

The additional parameters to `jekyll build` ensure that all possible
pages are built and checked.
