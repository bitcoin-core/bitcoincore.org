  - `id:`        each article translation must have a unique ID. Use the language code + `-name` field. e.g. `en-october15-report`
  - `permalink:` the must include the language code, end a trailing slash, e.g. `/en/2015/12/31/report/`.
  - `title:`     the translated title of the article

## Building

This website is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  To build
locally, [install Ruby 2.5.5](https://gorails.com/setup) using system
packages, [rvm](https://rvm.io), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), or another method.
Then clone this repository and change directory into it:

    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org.git
    cd bitcoincore.org

Install the `bundle` utility using the Ruby package manager, `gem`, and
then use `bundle` to install the rest of the Ruby packages needed to
build this site.  Note, depending on your system configuration, you may
need to run `gem` as the superuser by putting "sudo" followed by a space
before the `gem` command.  You shouldn't need to use `sudo` with the
`bundle` command.

    gem update --system
    gem install bundler
    bundle install

To preview the site (this will launch a tiny webserver on port 4000):

    bundle exec jekyll server --future

To simply build the site (output placed in the `_site` directory):

    bundle exec jekyll build --future

Note that the `--future` parameter is only required if you're adding any
pages dated in the future (such as prepared release announcements).

To test the site:

    bundle exec jekyll build --future --drafts --unpublished
    bundle exec htmlproofer --check-html --disable-external --url-ignore '/^\/bin/.*/' ./_site

The additional parameters to `jekyll build` ensure that all possible
pages are built and checked.
