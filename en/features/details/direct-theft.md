- **Wallet service**{:.fgred} users are vulnerable to direct theft
  because they don't control their own private keys.

- **Light wallet**{:.fggreen} users and **Bitcoin Core**{:.fggreen}
  users are not vulnerable because they do control their own private
  keys.

### Real Example

Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox reportedly had 650,000 bitcoins (worth $347
million USD) stolen from their customer deposits and their own operating
funds. They declared bankruptcy on 28 February 2014.

Even when the bankruptcy proceeding is complete, customers are unlikely to
recover more than a small fraction of the bitcoins they had on deposit.
