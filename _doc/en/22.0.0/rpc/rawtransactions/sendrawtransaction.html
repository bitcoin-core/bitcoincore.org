sendrawtransaction "hexstring" ( maxfeerate )

Submit a raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded) to local node and network.

The transaction will be sent unconditionally to all peers, so using sendrawtransaction
for manual rebroadcast may degrade privacy by leaking the transaction's origin, as
nodes will normally not rebroadcast non-wallet transactions already in their mempool.

A specific exception, RPC_TRANSACTION_ALREADY_IN_CHAIN, may throw if the transaction cannot be added to the mempool.

Related RPCs: createrawtransaction, signrawtransactionwithkey

Arguments:
1. hexstring     (string, required) The hex string of the raw transaction
2. maxfeerate    (numeric or string, optional, default="0.10") Reject transactions whose fee rate is higher than the specified value, expressed in BTC/kvB.
                 Set to 0 to accept any fee rate.
                 

Result:
"hex"    (string) The transaction hash in hex

Examples:

Create a transaction
> bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction "[{\"txid\" : \"mytxid\",\"vout\":0}]" "{\"myaddress\":0.01}"
Sign the transaction, and get back the hex
> bitcoin-cli signrawtransactionwithwallet "myhex"

Send the transaction (signed hex)
> bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction "signedhex"
