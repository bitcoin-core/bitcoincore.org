send [{"address":amount,...},{"data":"hex"},...] ( conf_target "estimate_mode" fee_rate options )

EXPERIMENTAL warning: this call may be changed in future releases.

Send a transaction.

Arguments:
1. outputs                     (json array, required) The outputs specified as key-value pairs.
                               Each key may only appear once, i.e. there can only be one 'data' output, and no address may be duplicated.
                               At least one output of either type must be specified.
                               For convenience, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also accepted.
     [
       {                       (json object)
         "address": amount,    (numeric or string, required) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address,
                               the value (float or string) is the amount in BTC
         ...
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "data": "hex",        (string, required) A key-value pair. The key must be "data", the value is hex-encoded data
       },
       ...
     ]
2. conf_target                 (numeric, optional, default=wallet -txconfirmtarget) Confirmation target in blocks
3. estimate_mode               (string, optional, default="unset") The fee estimate mode, must be one of (case insensitive):
                               "unset"
                               "economical"
                               "conservative"
4. fee_rate                    (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.
5. options                     (json object, optional) Options object that can be used to pass named arguments, listed below.

Named Arguments:
add_inputs                   (boolean, optional, default=false when "inputs" are specified, true otherwise) Automatically include coins from the wallet to cover the target amount.
                             
include_unsafe               (boolean, optional, default=false) Include inputs that are not safe to spend (unconfirmed transactions from outside keys and unconfirmed replacement transactions).
                             Warning: the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the unsafe inputs disappears.
                             If that happens, you will need to fund the transaction with different inputs and republish it.
minconf                      (numeric, optional, default=0) If add_inputs is specified, require inputs with at least this many confirmations.
maxconf                      (numeric, optional) If add_inputs is specified, require inputs with at most this many confirmations.
add_to_wallet                (boolean, optional, default=true) When false, returns a serialized transaction which will not be added to the wallet or broadcast
change_address               (string, optional, default=automatic) The bitcoin address to receive the change
change_position              (numeric, optional, default=random) The index of the change output
change_type                  (string, optional, default=set by -changetype) The output type to use. Only valid if change_address is not specified. Options are "legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32" and "bech32m".
fee_rate                     (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.
include_watching             (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Also select inputs which are watch only.
                             Only solvable inputs can be used. Watch-only destinations are solvable if the public key and/or output script was imported,
                             e.g. with 'importpubkey' or 'importmulti' with the 'pubkeys' or 'desc' field.
inputs                       (json array, optional, default=[]) Specify inputs instead of adding them automatically. A JSON array of JSON objects
     [
       "txid",               (string, required) The transaction id
       vout,                 (numeric, required) The output number
       sequence,             (numeric, required) The sequence number
       weight,               (numeric, optional, default=Calculated from wallet and solving data) The maximum weight for this input, including the weight of the outpoint and sequence number. Note that signature sizes are not guaranteed to be consistent, so the maximum DER signatures size of 73 bytes should be used when considering ECDSA signatures.Remember to convert serialized sizes to weight units when necessary.
       ...
     ]
locktime                     (numeric, optional, default=0) Raw locktime. Non-0 value also locktime-activates inputs
lock_unspents                (boolean, optional, default=false) Lock selected unspent outputs
psbt                         (boolean, optional, default=automatic) Always return a PSBT, implies add_to_wallet=false.
subtract_fee_from_outputs    (json array, optional, default=[]) Outputs to subtract the fee from, specified as integer indices.
                             The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
                             Those recipients will receive less bitcoins than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                             If no outputs are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
     [
       vout_index,           (numeric) The zero-based output index, before a change output is added.

                             "conservative"
replaceable                  (boolean, optional, default=wallet default) Marks this transaction as BIP125-replaceable.
                             Allows this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees
solving_data                 (json object, optional) Keys and scripts needed for producing a final transaction with a dummy signature.
                             Used for fee estimation during coin selection.

  "txid" : "hex",             (string, optional) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of the number of addresses.
  "hex" : "hex",              (string, optional) If add_to_wallet is false, the hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s)
  "psbt" : "str"              (string, optional) If more signatures are needed, or if add_to_wallet is false, the base64-encoded (partially) signed transaction

Examples:

Send 0.1 BTC with a confirmation target of 6 blocks in economical fee estimate mode

Send 0.3 BTC with a fee rate of 25 sat/vB using named arguments

Create a transaction that should confirm the next block, with a specific input, and return result without adding to wallet or broadcasting to the network
> bitcoin-cli send '{"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl": 0.1}' 1 economical '{"add_to_wallet": false, "inputs": [{"txid":"a08e6907dbbd3d809776dbfc5d82e371b764ed838b5655e72f463568df1aadf0", "vout":1}]}'
