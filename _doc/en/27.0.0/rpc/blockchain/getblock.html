getblock "blockhash" ( verbosity )

If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about block <hash>.
If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction.
If verbosity is 3, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction, including prevout information for inputs (only for unpruned blocks in the current best chain).

Arguments:
1. blockhash    (string, required) The block hash
2. verbosity    (numeric, optional, default=1) 0 for hex-encoded data, 1 for a JSON object, 2 for JSON object with transaction data, and 3 for JSON object with transaction data including prevout information for inputs

Result (for verbosity = 0):
"hex"    (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'

Result (for verbosity = 1):
