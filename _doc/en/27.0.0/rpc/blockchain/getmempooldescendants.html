getmempooldescendants "txid" ( verbose )

If txid is in the mempool, returns all in-mempool descendants.

Arguments:
1. txid       (string, required) The transaction id (must be in mempool)
2. verbose    (boolean, optional, default=false) True for a json object, false for array of transaction ids

Result (for verbose = false):
[           (json array)
  "hex",    (string) The transaction id of an in-mempool descendant transaction
  ...
]

Result (for verbose = true):
{                                         (json object)

    "vsize" : n,                          (numeric) virtual transaction size as defined in BIP 141. This is different from actual serialized size for witness transactions as witness data is discounted.
    "weight" : n,                         (numeric) transaction weight as defined in BIP 141.
    "time" : xxx,                         (numeric) local time transaction entered pool in seconds since 1 Jan 1970 GMT

    "descendantcount" : n,                (numeric) number of in-mempool descendant transactions (including this one)
    "descendantsize" : n,                 (numeric) virtual transaction size of in-mempool descendants (including this one)
    "ancestorcount" : n,                  (numeric) number of in-mempool ancestor transactions (including this one)

      "base" : n,                         (numeric) transaction fee, denominated in BTC
      "modified" : n,                     (numeric) transaction fee with fee deltas used for mining priority, denominated in BTC
      "ancestor" : n,                     (numeric) transaction fees of in-mempool ancestors (including this one) with fee deltas used for mining priority, denominated in BTC
      "descendant" : n                    (numeric) transaction fees of in-mempool descendants (including this one) with fee deltas used for mining priority, denominated in BTC
    },
    "depends" : [                         (json array) unconfirmed transactions used as inputs for this transaction

    ],
    "bip125-replaceable" : true|false,    (boolean) Whether this transaction signals BIP125 replaceability or has an unconfirmed ancestor signaling BIP125 replaceability.
                                          
    "unbroadcast" : true|false            (boolean) Whether this transaction is currently unbroadcast (initial broadcast not yet acknowledged by any peers)
