pruneblockchain height

Attempts to delete block and undo data up to a specified height or timestamp, if eligible for pruning.
Requires `-prune` to be enabled at startup. While pruned data may be re-fetched in some cases (e.g., via `getblockfrompeer`), local deletion is irreversible.

Arguments:
1. height    (numeric, required) The block height to prune up to. May be set to a discrete height, or to a UNIX epoch time
             to prune blocks whose block time is at least 2 hours older than the provided timestamp.

Result:
n    (numeric) Height of the last block pruned

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli pruneblockchain 1000
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "pruneblockchain", "params": [1000]}' -H 'content-type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
