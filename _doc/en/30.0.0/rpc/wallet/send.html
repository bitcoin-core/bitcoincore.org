send [{"address":amount,...},{"data":"hex"},...] ( conf_target "estimate_mode" fee_rate options version )

EXPERIMENTAL warning: this call may be changed in future releases.

Send a transaction.

Arguments:
1. outputs                     (json array, required) The outputs specified as key-value pairs.
                               Each key may only appear once, i.e. there can only be one 'data' output, and no address may be duplicated.
                               At least one output of either type must be specified.
                               For convenience, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also accepted.
     [
       {                       (json object)
         "address": amount,    (numeric or string, required) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address,
                               the value (float or string) is the amount in BTC
         ...
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "data": "hex",        (string, required) A key-value pair. The key must be "data", the value is hex-encoded data that becomes a part of an OP_RETURN output
       },
       ...
     ]
2. conf_target                 (numeric, optional, default=wallet -txconfirmtarget) Confirmation target in blocks
3. estimate_mode               (string, optional, default="unset") The fee estimate mode, must be one of (case insensitive):
                               unset, economical, conservative 
                               unset means no mode set (economical mode is used if the transaction is replaceable;
                               otherwise, conservative mode is used). 
                               economical estimates use a shorter time horizon, making them more
                               responsive to short-term drops in the prevailing fee market. This mode
                               potentially returns a lower fee rate estimate.
                               conservative estimates use a longer time horizon, making them
                               less responsive to short-term drops in the prevailing fee market. This mode
                               potentially returns a higher fee rate estimate.
                               
4. fee_rate                    (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.
5. options                     (json object, optional) Options object that can be used to pass named arguments, listed below.
6. version                     (numeric, optional, default=2) Transaction version

Named Arguments:
add_inputs                   (boolean, optional, default=false when "inputs" are specified, true otherwise) Automatically include coins from the wallet to cover the target amount.
                             
include_unsafe               (boolean, optional, default=false) Include inputs that are not safe to spend (unconfirmed transactions from outside keys and unconfirmed replacement transactions).
                             Warning: the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the unsafe inputs disappears.
                             If that happens, you will need to fund the transaction with different inputs and republish it.
minconf                      (numeric, optional, default=0) If add_inputs is specified, require inputs with at least this many confirmations.
maxconf                      (numeric, optional) If add_inputs is specified, require inputs with at most this many confirmations.
add_to_wallet                (boolean, optional, default=true) When false, returns a serialized transaction which will not be added to the wallet or broadcast
change_address               (string, optional, default=automatic) The bitcoin address to receive the change
change_position              (numeric, optional, default=random) The index of the change output
change_type                  (string, optional, default=set by -changetype) The output type to use. Only valid if change_address is not specified. Options are "legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32", "bech32m".
fee_rate                     (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.
include_watching             (boolean, optional, default="false") (DEPRECATED) No longer used
inputs                       (json array, optional, default=[]) Specify inputs instead of adding them automatically.
     [
       {                     (json object)
         "txid": "hex",      (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout": n,          (numeric, required) The output number
         "sequence": n,      (numeric, optional, default=depends on the value of the 'replaceable' and 'locktime' arguments) The sequence number
         "weight": n,        (numeric, optional, default=Calculated from wallet and solving data) The maximum weight for this input, including the weight of the outpoint and sequence number. Note that signature sizes are not guaranteed to be consistent, so the maximum DER signatures size of 73 bytes should be used when considering ECDSA signatures.Remember to convert serialized sizes to weight units when necessary.
       },
       ...
     ]
locktime                     (numeric, optional, default=locktime close to block height to prevent fee sniping) Raw locktime. Non-0 value also locktime-activates inputs

psbt                         (boolean, optional, default=automatic) Always return a PSBT, implies add_to_wallet=false.
subtract_fee_from_outputs    (json array, optional, default=[]) Outputs to subtract the fee from, specified as integer indices.
                             The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
                             Those recipients will receive less bitcoins than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                             If no outputs are specified here, the sender pays the fee.

                             potentially returns a lower fee rate estimate.

Examples:

Send 0.1 BTC with a confirmation target of 6 blocks in economical fee estimate mode

Send 0.2 BTC with a fee rate of 1 sat/vB using the options argument

Send 0.3 BTC with a fee rate of 25 sat/vB using named arguments
> bitcoin-cli -named send outputs='{"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl": 0.3}' fee_rate=25

Create a transaction that should confirm the next block, with a specific input, and return result without adding to wallet or broadcasting to the network
> bitcoin-cli send '{"bc1q09vm5lfy0j5reeulh4x5752q25uqqvz34hufdl": 0.1}' 1 economical '{"add_to_wallet": false, "inputs": [{"txid":"a08e6907dbbd3d809776dbfc5d82e371b764ed838b5655e72f463568df1aadf0", "vout":1}]}'
