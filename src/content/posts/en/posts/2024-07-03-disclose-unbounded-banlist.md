excerpt: >
  Nodes could be subject to CPU and memory DoS when attacked by lots of distinct IPs. A fix was released on August 1st, 2020 in Bitcoin Core 0.20.1.
---

Bitcoin Core maintained an unlimited list of banned IP addresses and performed a quadratic operation
on it. This could lead to an OOM crash and a CPU Dos.

This issue is considered **High** severity.

## Details

Bitcoin Core maintained a list of banned IP addresses. This list was not bounded and could be
manipulated by an adversary. Adding new entries to this list was particularly cheap for an attacker
when considering IPV6. In addition, when receiving a `GETADDR` message, Bitcoin Core would scan the
entire ban list for every single address to be returned (up to 2500).

## Attribution

Calin Culianu first responsibly disclosed it. Calin later publicly disclosed the bug in [a PR
comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15617#issuecomment-640898523).

On the same day Jason Cox from Bitcoin ABC emailed the Bitcoin Core project to share this same
report they also received.
