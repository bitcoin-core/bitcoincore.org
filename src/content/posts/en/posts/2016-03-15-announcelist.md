In an effort to increase communications, we are now providing opt-in, _announcement-only_ information for users of Bitcoin Core to receive notifications of security issues and new releases.

While the Bitcoin Core project has a variety of communication channels, there have been a number of requests for a method of receiving only important announcements.  This new source is intended to be extremely low volume, focused on critical notifications as well as to announce new releases.

If you use Bitcoin Core, please consider [subscribing][subscribe].
