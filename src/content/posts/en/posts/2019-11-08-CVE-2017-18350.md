Technical Details
==========
CVE-2017-18350 is a buffer overflow vulnerability which allows a malicious SOCKS proxy server to overwrite the program stack on systems with a signed `char` type (including common 32-bit and 64-bit x86 PCs).

The vulnerability was introduced in [60a87bce873 (SOCKS5 support)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/60a87bce873ce1f76a80b7b8546e83a0cd4e07a5) and first released in Bitcoin Core v0.7.0rc1 in 2012 Aug 27. A fix was hidden in [d90a00eabed ("Improve and document SOCKS code")](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/d90a00eabed0f3f1acea4834ad489484d0012372) released in v0.15.1, 2017 Nov 6.

To be vulnerable, the node must be configured to use such a malicious proxy in the first place. Note that using *any* proxy over an insecure network (such as the Internet) is potentially a vulnerability since the connection could be intercepted for such a purpose.

Upon a connection request from the node, the malicious proxy would respond with an acknowledgement of a different target domain name than the one requested. Normally this acknowledgement is entirely ignored, but if the length uses the high bit (ie, a length 128-255 inclusive), it will be interpreted by vulnerable versions as a negative number instead. When the negative number is passed to the recv() system call to read the domain name, it is converted back to an unsigned/positive number, but at a much wider size (typically 32-bit), resulting in an effectively infinite read into and beyond the 256-byte dummy stack buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, the dummy buffer was changed to an explicitly unsigned data type, avoiding the conversion to/from a negative number.
