Disclosure of the details of an integer overflow bug which causes an assertion
crash, a fix for which was released on September 14th, 2021 in Bitcoin Core
version v22.0.

This issue is considered **High** severity.

## Details

`CAddrMan` has a 32-bit `nIdCount` field that is incremented on every insertion
into addrman, and which then becomes the identifier for the new entry. By
getting the victim to insert 2<sup>32</sup> entries (through e.g. spamming addr
messages), this identifier overflows, which leads to an assertion crash.
