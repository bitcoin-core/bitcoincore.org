A node could be stalled for hours when processing the orphans of a specially crafted unconfirmed
transaction.

This issue is considered **High** severity.

## Details

After accepting a transaction into its mempool, the node would go through its cache of orphan
transactions to find if this new accepted transaction makes it possible to accept any. This search
was quadratic: for each output in the newly accepted transaction it would go through all cached
orphan transactions (limited to 100). By specially crafting the orphan transactions to be invalid
yet expensive to validate a node could be stalled for several hours.

The stall was fixed by Pieter Wuille in [PR #15644](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15644)
by interrupting the orphan resolution to process new messages when a match is found (whether the
orphan turns out to be valid or not).
