Hereby I'm announcing Marco Falke as the new Testing & QA maintainer for
Bitcoin Core.

Testing and QA has always been essential to this project, and with the growing
pace of development it has become more critical than ever.

Marco has been doing a great job contributing to the project for the last year,
especially on the test framework and unit tests, increasing coverage, but also
by sanity-checking the wallet fee functionality and with reviewing other pull
requests. So it's pretty much what he's been already doing, and it's natural to
consider him for this.

He's going to oversee and merge pull requests for the QA and Testing framework,
and keep an eye on the overall quality of testing.

Welcome to the team Marco!

Regards,

Wladimir van der Laan
