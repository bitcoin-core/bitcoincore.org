excerpt: >
  Attackers sending large incomplete messages would cause high memory usage. A fix was released on April 27th, 2015 in Bitcoin Core 0.10.1.
---

A node could be forced to allocate large buffers when receiving a message, which could be leveraged to remotely crash it by OOM.

This issue is considered **Medium** severity.

## Details

Without a tighter bound, received messages' size was limited by the maximum serialized message size
of 32 MiB. An attacker could force a node to allocate this much RAM per connection, which may lead
to an OOM.

[PR #5843](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5843) reduced the size P2P messages can have
before receiving the payload. This reduces the per-peer receive buffer memory size a malicious peer
can cause. The PR reduced the number from 32 MiB to 2 MiB, which was later increased back to 4 MB as
part of the Segwit BIP144 changes.
