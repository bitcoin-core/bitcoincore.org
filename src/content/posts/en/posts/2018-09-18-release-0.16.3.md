Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3 is now available for [download][download
page] with a fix for a denial-of-service vulnerability introduced in
Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 and affecting all subsequent versions though to
0.16.2.  We highly recommend users of all affected versions immediately
upgrade to 0.16.3.

Security issue [CVE-2018-17144][]: it was discovered that older versions of Bitcoin Core
will crash if they try to process a block containing a transaction that
attempts to spend the same input twice.  Such blocks are invalid, so
they can only be created by a miner willing to sacrifice their allowed
income for creating a block of at least 12.5 BTC (about $80,000 USD as
of this writing).  This release eliminates the crash, allowing the
software to quietly reject such invalid blocks.

For a complete list of changes, please see the [release notes][].  If
have any questions, please stop by our [IRC chatroom][irc] and weâ€™ll do
our best to help you.
