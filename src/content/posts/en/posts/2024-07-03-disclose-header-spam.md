  Nodes could be spammed with low-difficulty headers, which could be used to crash it. A fix was released on September 14th, 2017 in Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.

After Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 and before Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 a node could be spammed with minimum
difficulty headers, which could possibly be leveraged to crash it by OOM.

This issue is considered **Medium** severity.

## Details

Before the introduction of [headers
pre-synchronisation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717), nodes relied exclusively on
checkpoints to avoid getting spammed by low-difficulty headers.

In Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 a check for headers forking before the last checkpoint's height was moved to
after storing the header in `mapBlockIndex`. This allowed an attacker to grow the map unboundedly by
spamming headers whose parent is the genesis block (which only need difficulty 1 to create), as such
blocks bypassed the checkpoint logic.
