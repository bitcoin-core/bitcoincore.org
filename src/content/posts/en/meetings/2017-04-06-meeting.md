- High priority review

## Work in progress

### background

Since a lot of developers where missing or not focussed on the meeting because of the Financial Cryptography conference Sdaftuar asked if anyone wanted to give updates on what they're working on, to get some overview and conversations started.

### meeting comments

- Luke-jr is working on an UTXO index by scriptPubKey for sweeping purposes. Wumpus points out PR [#9806][] is trying to do the same.
- Jonasschnelli is working on a Bloom Filter Digest which he'd like to have for the hybrid full block SPV mode talked about in [2016-11-10 meeting](/en/meetings/2016/11/10/#hybrid-spv).
- Sipa has been working on things related to database/cache/flush/memory usage.
- Morcos is coding and recoding fee estimation for months, but it's much more complicated and will be hard to review.
- Sdaftuar has been working on CreateNewBlock, introducing a way to skip recently added transactions if the block income for doing so is below some theshold.
- Jtimon worked on some refactoring PRs, like [#9494][], [#10119][] and [#10118][]

## High priority review

[High priority review project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/8) on Github.

Jtimon thinks PR [#7729][] (introduce 'label' API for wallet) should be added to the priority list, as it blocks the removal of the accounts system. Wumpus agrees, but notes people should review the API, not the code, as that is outdated by now.

## Comic relief
