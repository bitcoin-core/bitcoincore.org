    "size" : n,             (numeric) virtual transaction size as defined in BIP 141. This is different from actual serialized size for witness transactions as witness data is discounted.

    "ancestorcount" : n,    (numeric) number of in-mempool ancestor transactions (including this one)
    "ancestorsize" : n,     (numeric) virtual transaction size of in-mempool ancestors (including this one)
    "ancestorfees" : n,     (numeric) modified fees (see above) of in-mempool ancestors (including this one)
    "wtxid" : hash,         (string) hash of serialized transaction, including witness data

        "transactionid",    (string) parent transaction id
       ... ]
