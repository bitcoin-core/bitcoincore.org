getblock "blockhash" ( verbosity )

If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about block <hash>.
If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction. 

Arguments:
1. blockhash    (string, required) The block hash
2. verbosity    (numeric, optional, default=1) 0 for hex-encoded data, 1 for a json object, and 2 for json object with transaction data

Result (for verbosity = 0):
"data"             (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.

Result (for verbosity = 1):
{
  "hash" : "hash",     (string) the block hash (same as provided)
  "confirmations" : n,   (numeric) The number of confirmations, or -1 if the block is not on the main chain
  "size" : n,            (numeric) The block size
  "strippedsize" : n,    (numeric) The block size excluding witness data
  "weight" : n           (numeric) The block weight as defined in BIP 141
  "height" : n,          (numeric) The block height or index
  "version" : n,         (numeric) The block version
  "versionHex" : "00000000", (string) The block version formatted in hexadecimal
  "merkleroot" : "xxxx", (string) The merkle root
  "tx" : [               (array of string) The transaction ids
     "transactionid"     (string) The transaction id
     ,...
  ],
  "time" : ttt,          (numeric) The block time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT)
  "mediantime" : ttt,    (numeric) The median block time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT)
  "nonce" : n,           (numeric) The nonce
  "bits" : "1d00ffff", (string) The bits
  "difficulty" : x.xxx,  (numeric) The difficulty
  "chainwork" : "xxxx",  (string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the chain up to this block (in hex)
  "nTx" : n,             (numeric) The number of transactions in the block.
  "previousblockhash" : "hash",  (string) The hash of the previous block
  "nextblockhash" : "hash"       (string) The hash of the next block
}

Result (for verbosity = 2):
{
  ...,                     Same output as verbosity = 1.
  "tx" : [               (array of Objects) The transactions in the format of the getrawtransaction RPC. Different from verbosity = 1 "tx" result.
         ,...
  ],
  ,...                     Same output as verbosity = 1.
