getbalance ( "dummy" minconf include_watchonly )

Returns the total available balance.
The available balance is what the wallet considers currently spendable, and is
thus affected by options which limit spendability such as -spendzeroconfchange.

Arguments:
1. dummy                (string, optional) Remains for backward compatibility. Must be excluded or set to "*".
2. minconf              (numeric, optional, default=0) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.
3. include_watchonly    (boolean, optional, default=false) Also include balance in watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')

Result:
amount              (numeric) The total amount in BTC received for this wallet.

Examples:

The total amount in the wallet with 1 or more confirmations
> bitcoin-cli getbalance 

The total amount in the wallet at least 6 blocks confirmed
> bitcoin-cli getbalance "*" 6
