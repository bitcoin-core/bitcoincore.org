getblocktemplate "template_request"

If the request parameters include a 'mode' key, that is used to explicitly select between the default 'template' request or a 'proposal'.
It returns data needed to construct a block to work on.
For full specification, see BIPs 22, 23, 9, and 145:
    https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki

Arguments:
1. template_request         (json object, required) A json object in the following spec
     {
       "mode": "str",       (string, optional) This must be set to "template", "proposal" (see BIP 23), or omitted
       "capabilities": [    (json array, optional) A list of strings
         "support",         (string) client side supported feature, 'longpoll', 'coinbasetxn', 'coinbasevalue', 'proposal', 'serverlist', 'workid'
         ...
       ],
       "rules": [           (json array, required) A list of strings
         "support",         (string) client side supported softfork deployment
         ...
       ],
     }

Result:
{
  "version" : n,                    (numeric) The preferred block version
  "rules" : [ "rulename", ... ],    (array of strings) specific block rules that are to be enforced
  "vbavailable" : {                 (json object) set of pending, supported versionbit (BIP 9) softfork deployments
      "rulename" : bitnumber          (numeric) identifies the bit number as indicating acceptance and readiness for the named softfork rule
      ,...
  },
  "vbrequired" : n,                 (numeric) bit mask of versionbits the server requires set in submissions
  "previousblockhash" : "xxxx",     (string) The hash of current highest block
  "transactions" : [                (array) contents of non-coinbase transactions that should be included in the next block
      {
         "data" : "xxxx",             (string) transaction data encoded in hexadecimal (byte-for-byte)
         "txid" : "xxxx",             (string) transaction id encoded in little-endian hexadecimal

         "depends" : [                (array) array of numbers 
             n                          (numeric) transactions before this one (by 1-based index in 'transactions' list) that must be present in the final block if this one is
             ,...
         ],
         "fee": n,                    (numeric) difference in value between transaction inputs and outputs (in satoshis); for coinbase transactions, this is a negative Number of the total collected block fees (ie, not including the block subsidy); if key is not present, fee is unknown and clients MUST NOT assume there isn't one
         "sigops" : n,                (numeric) total SigOps cost, as counted for purposes of block limits; if key is not present, sigop cost is unknown and clients MUST NOT assume it is zero

  },
  "coinbasevalue" : n,              (numeric) maximum allowable input to coinbase transaction, including the generation award and transaction fees (in satoshis)
