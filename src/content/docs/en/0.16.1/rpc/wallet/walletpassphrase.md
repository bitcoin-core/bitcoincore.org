walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout

Stores the wallet decryption key in memory for 'timeout' seconds.
This is needed prior to performing transactions related to private keys such as sending bitcoins

Arguments:
1. "passphrase"     (string, required) The wallet passphrase
2. timeout            (numeric, required) The time to keep the decryption key in seconds. Limited to at most 1073741824 (2^30) seconds.
                                          Any value greater than 1073741824 seconds will be set to 1073741824 seconds.

Note:
Issuing the walletpassphrase command while the wallet is already unlocked will set a new unlock
time that overrides the old one.

Examples:

Unlock the wallet for 60 seconds
> bitcoin-cli walletpassphrase "my pass phrase" 60

Lock the wallet again (before 60 seconds)
> bitcoin-cli walletlock 

As json rpc call
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "walletpassphrase", "params": ["my pass phrase", 60] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
