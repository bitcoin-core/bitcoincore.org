walletcreatefundedpsbt ( [{"txid":"hex","vout":n,"sequence":n,"weight":n},...] ) [{"address":amount,...},{"data":"hex"},...] ( locktime options bip32derivs )

Creates and funds a transaction in the Partially Signed Transaction format.
Implements the Creator and Updater roles.
All existing inputs must either have their previous output transaction be in the wallet
or be in the UTXO set. Solving data must be provided for non-wallet inputs.

Arguments:
1. inputs                             (json array, optional) Leave empty to add inputs automatically. See add_inputs option.
     [
       {                              (json object)
         "txid": "hex",               (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout": n,                   (numeric, required) The output number
         "sequence": n,               (numeric, optional, default=depends on the value of the 'locktime' and 'options.replaceable' arguments) The sequence number
         "weight": n,                 (numeric, optional, default=Calculated from wallet and solving data) The maximum weight for this input, including the weight of the outpoint and sequence number. Note that signature sizes are not guaranteed to be consistent, so the maximum DER signatures size of 73 bytes should be used when considering ECDSA signatures.Remember to convert serialized sizes to weight units when necessary.
       },
       ...
     ]
2. outputs                            (json array, required) The outputs (key-value pairs), where none of the keys are duplicated.
                                      That is, each address can only appear once and there can only be one 'data' object.
                                      For compatibility reasons, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also
                                      accepted as second parameter.
     [
       {                              (json object)
         "address": amount,           (numeric or string, required) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address, the value (float or string) is the amount in BTC
         ...
       },
       {                              (json object)
         "data": "hex",               (string, required) A key-value pair. The key must be "data", the value is hex-encoded data
       },
       ...
     ]
3. locktime                           (numeric, optional, default=0) Raw locktime. Non-0 value also locktime-activates inputs
4. options                            (json object, optional)
     {
       "add_inputs": bool,            (boolean, optional, default=false) If inputs are specified, automatically include more if they are not enough.
       "include_unsafe": bool,        (boolean, optional, default=false) Include inputs that are not safe to spend (unconfirmed transactions from outside keys and unconfirmed replacement transactions).
                                      Warning: the resulting transaction may become invalid if one of the unsafe inputs disappears.
                                      If that happens, you will need to fund the transaction with different inputs and republish it.
       "changeAddress": "hex",        (string, optional, default=pool address) The bitcoin address to receive the change
       "changePosition": n,           (numeric, optional, default=random) The index of the change output
       "change_type": "str",          (string, optional, default=set by -changetype) The output type to use. Only valid if changeAddress is not specified. Options are "legacy", "p2sh-segwit", and "bech32".
       "includeWatching": bool,       (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Also select inputs which are watch only
       "lockUnspents": bool,          (boolean, optional, default=false) Lock selected unspent outputs
       "fee_rate": amount,            (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in sat/vB.
       "feeRate": amount,             (numeric or string, optional, default=not set, fall back to wallet fee estimation) Specify a fee rate in BTC/kvB.
       "subtractFeeFromOutputs": [    (json array, optional, default=[]) The outputs to subtract the fee from.
                                      The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
                                      Those recipients will receive less bitcoins than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                                      If no outputs are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
         vout_index,                  (numeric) The zero-based output index, before a change output is added.
         ...
       ],

       "estimate_mode": "str",        (string, optional, default="unset") The fee estimate mode, must be one of (case insensitive):
                                      "unset"
                                      "economical"
                                      "conservative"
       "replaceable": bool,           (boolean, optional, default=wallet default) Marks this transaction as BIP125-replaceable.
                                      Allows this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees
       "solving_data": {              (json object, optional) Keys and scripts needed for producing a final transaction with a dummy signature.
                                      Used for fee estimation during coin selection.
         "pubkeys": [                 (json array, optional, default=[]) Public keys involved in this transaction.
           "pubkey",                  (string) A public key

         "descriptors": [             (json array, optional, default=[]) Descriptors that provide solving data for this transaction.
           "descriptor",              (string) A descriptor
           ...
         ],
       },
     }
5. bip32derivs                        (boolean, optional, default=true) Include BIP 32 derivation paths for public keys if we know them

Result:
{                     (json object)
  "psbt" : "str",     (string) The resulting raw transaction (base64-encoded string)
  "fee" : n,          (numeric) Fee in BTC the resulting transaction pays
