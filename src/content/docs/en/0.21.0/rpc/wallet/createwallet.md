createwallet "wallet_name" ( disable_private_keys blank "passphrase" avoid_reuse descriptors load_on_startup )

Creates and loads a new wallet.

Arguments:
1. wallet_name             (string, required) The name for the new wallet. If this is a path, the wallet will be created at the path location.
2. disable_private_keys    (boolean, optional, default=false) Disable the possibility of private keys (only watchonlys are possible in this mode).
3. blank                   (boolean, optional, default=false) Create a blank wallet. A blank wallet has no keys or HD seed. One can be set using sethdseed.
4. passphrase              (string) Encrypt the wallet with this passphrase.
5. avoid_reuse             (boolean, optional, default=false) Keep track of coin reuse, and treat dirty and clean coins differently with privacy considerations in mind.
6. descriptors             (boolean, optional, default=false) Create a native descriptor wallet. The wallet will use descriptors internally to handle address creation
7. load_on_startup         (boolean, optional, default=null) Save wallet name to persistent settings and load on startup. True to add wallet to startup list, false to remove, null to leave unchanged.

Result:
{                       (json object)
  "name" : "str",       (string) The wallet name if created successfully. If the wallet was created using a full path, the wallet_name will be the full path.
  "warning" : "str"     (string) Warning message if wallet was not loaded cleanly.
