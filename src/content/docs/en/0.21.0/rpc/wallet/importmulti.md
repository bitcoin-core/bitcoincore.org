importmulti "requests" ( "options" )

Import addresses/scripts (with private or public keys, redeem script (P2SH)), optionally rescanning the blockchain from the earliest creation time of the imported scripts. Requires a new wallet backup.
If an address/script is imported without all of the private keys required to spend from that address, it will be watchonly. The 'watchonly' option must be set to true in this case or a warning will be returned.
Conversely, if all the private keys are provided and the address/script is spendable, the watchonly option must be set to false, or a warning will be returned.

Note: This call can take over an hour to complete if rescan is true, during that time, other rpc calls
may report that the imported keys, addresses or scripts exist but related transactions are still missing.
Note: Use "getwalletinfo" to query the scanning progress.

Arguments:
1. requests                                                         (json array, required) Data to be imported

         "desc": "str",                                             (string) Descriptor to import. If using descriptor, do not also provide address/scriptPubKey, scripts, or pubkeys
         "scriptPubKey": "<script>" | { "address":"<address>" },    (string / json, required) Type of scriptPubKey (string for script, json for address). Should not be provided if using a descriptor
         "timestamp": timestamp | "now",                            (integer / string, required) Creation time of the key expressed in UNIX epoch time,
                                                                    or the string "now" to substitute the current synced blockchain time. The timestamp of the oldest

                                                                    "now" can be specified to bypass scanning, for keys which are known to never have been used, and
                                                                    0 can be specified to scan the entire blockchain. Blocks up to 2 hours before the earliest key

         "redeemscript": "str",                                     (string) Allowed only if the scriptPubKey is a P2SH or P2SH-P2WSH address/scriptPubKey

2. options                                                          (json object, optional)

Result:
[                              (json array) Response is an array with the same size as the input that has the execution result
  {                            (json object)
