getblock "blockhash" ( verbosity )

If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'.
If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about block <hash>.
If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about block <hash> and information about each transaction. 

Arguments:
1. blockhash    (string, required) The block hash
2. verbosity    (numeric, optional, default=1) 0 for hex-encoded data, 1 for a json object, and 2 for json object with transaction data

Result (for verbosity = 0):
"hex"    (string) A string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for block 'hash'

Result (for verbosity = 1):
{                                 (json object)
  "hash" : "hex",                 (string) the block hash (same as provided)
  "confirmations" : n,            (numeric) The number of confirmations, or -1 if the block is not on the main chain
  "size" : n,                     (numeric) The block size
  "strippedsize" : n,             (numeric) The block size excluding witness data
  "weight" : n,                   (numeric) The block weight as defined in BIP 141
  "height" : n,                   (numeric) The block height or index
  "version" : n,                  (numeric) The block version
  "versionHex" : "hex",           (string) The block version formatted in hexadecimal
  "merkleroot" : "hex",           (string) The merkle root
  "tx" : [                        (json array) The transaction ids
    "hex",                        (string) The transaction id
    ...
  ],
  "time" : xxx,                   (numeric) The block time expressed in UNIX epoch time
  "mediantime" : xxx,             (numeric) The median block time expressed in UNIX epoch time
  "nonce" : n,                    (numeric) The nonce
  "bits" : "hex",                 (string) The bits
  "difficulty" : n,               (numeric) The difficulty
  "chainwork" : "hex",            (string) Expected number of hashes required to produce the chain up to this block (in hex)
  "nTx" : n,                      (numeric) The number of transactions in the block
  "previousblockhash" : "hex",    (string) The hash of the previous block
  "nextblockhash" : "hex"         (string) The hash of the next block
}

Result (for verbosity = 2):
{             (json object)
  ...,        Same output as verbosity = 1
  "tx" : [    (json array)
    {         (json object)
      ...     The transactions in the format of the getrawtransaction RPC. Different from verbosity = 1 "tx" result
    },
    ...
  ]
}
