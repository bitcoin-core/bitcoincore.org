getblocktemplate ( "template_request" )

If the request parameters include a 'mode' key, that is used to explicitly select between the default 'template' request or a 'proposal'.
It returns data needed to construct a block to work on.
For full specification, see BIPs 22, 23, 9, and 145:

Arguments:
1. template_request         (json object, optional, default={}) Format of the template
     {
       "mode": "str",       (string, optional) This must be set to "template", "proposal" (see BIP 23), or omitted
       "capabilities": [    (json array, optional) A list of strings
         "str",             (string) client side supported feature, 'longpoll', 'coinbasevalue', 'proposal', 'serverlist', 'workid'

         "segwit",          (string, required) (literal) indicates client side segwit support
