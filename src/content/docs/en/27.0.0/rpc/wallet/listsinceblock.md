listsinceblock ( "blockhash" target_confirmations include_watchonly include_removed include_change "label" )

Get all transactions in blocks since block [blockhash], or all transactions if omitted.
If "blockhash" is no longer a part of the main chain, transactions from the fork point onward are included.
Additionally, if include_removed is set, transactions affecting the wallet which were removed are returned in the "removed" array.

Arguments:
1. blockhash               (string, optional) If set, the block hash to list transactions since, otherwise list all transactions.
2. target_confirmations    (numeric, optional, default=1) Return the nth block hash from the main chain. e.g. 1 would mean the best block hash. Note: this is not used as a filter, but only affects [lastblock] in the return value
3. include_watchonly       (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')
4. include_removed         (boolean, optional, default=true) Show transactions that were removed due to a reorg in the "removed" array
                           (not guaranteed to work on pruned nodes)
5. include_change          (boolean, optional, default=false) Also add entries for change outputs.
                           
6. label                   (string, optional) Return only incoming transactions paying to addresses with the specified label.

      "confirmations" : n,                 (numeric) The number of confirmations for the transaction. Negative confirmations means the
                                           transaction conflicted that many blocks ago.
      "generated" : true|false,            (boolean, optional) Only present if the transaction's only input is a coinbase one.

                                           Only present when the transaction has 0 confirmations (or negative confirmations, if conflicted).

        "hex",                             (string) The transaction id.

      ],
      "replaced_by_txid" : "hex",          (string, optional) Only if 'category' is 'send'. The txid if this tx was replaced.
      "replaces_txid" : "hex",             (string, optional) Only if 'category' is 'send'. The txid if this tx replaces another.
      "to" : "str",                        (string, optional) If a comment to is associated with the transaction.

      "bip125-replaceable" : "str",        (string) ("yes|no|unknown") Whether this transaction signals BIP125 replaceability or has an unconfirmed ancestor signaling BIP125 replaceability.
                                           May be unknown for unconfirmed transactions not in the mempool because their unconfirmed ancestors are unknown.
      "parent_descs" : [                   (json array, optional) Only if 'category' is 'received'. List of parent descriptors for the scriptPubKey of this coin.

                                           Note: transactions that were re-added in the active chain will appear as-is in this array, and may thus have a positive confirmation count.
    ...
  ],
  "lastblock" : "hex"                      (string) The hash of the block (target_confirmations-1) from the best block on the main chain, or the genesis hash if the referenced block does not exist yet. This is typically used to feed back into listsinceblock the next time you call it. So you would generally use a target_confirmations of say 6, so you will be continually re-notified of transactions until they've reached 6 confirmations plus any new ones
