This page summarizes policies in relation to disclosing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Core,
as well as provides a summary of historical Security Advisories.

## Policy

All vulnerabilities should be reported to security@bitcoincore.org (see
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for
details). When reported, a vulnerability will be assigned a severity category.
We differentiate between 4 classes of vulnerabilities:

### Critical

Bugs that threaten the fundamental security and integrity of the entire Bitcoin
network. These are bugs that allow for coin theft at the protocol level, the
creation of coins outside of the specified issuance schedule, or permanent,
network-wide chain splits.

Examples:
* A bug allowing inflating the money supply by spending the same transaction
  output twice within a block ([CVE-2018-17144](/en/2018/09/20/notice/)).
* A consensus failure where nodes running older software rejected a block that
  newer software accepted due to an underlying database limit, causing a
  network-wide chain split ([BIP
  50](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki)).

### High

Bugs with a significant impact on affected nodes or the network. These are
typically exploitable remotely under default configurations and can cause
widespread disruption.

Examples:
* A remotely triggerable crash that could take many nodes offline
  ([CVE-2024-35202](/en/2024/10/08/disclose-blocktxn-crash/)).
* A denial-of-service attack that causes a node to stall for an extended
  period, preventing it from processing new transactions and blocks
  ([CVE-2024-52914](/en/2024/07/03/disclose-orphan-dos/)).
* A memory exhaustion vulnerability that could be triggered remotely to crash
  nodes by having them store an excessive amount of block headers
  ([CVE-2019-25220](/en/2024/09/18/disclose-headers-oom/)).

### Medium

Bugs that can noticeably degrade the network's or a node's performance or
functionality, but are limited in their scope or exploitability. These might
require special conditions to trigger, such as non-default settings, or result
in service degradation rather than a complete node failure.

Examples:
* A potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability on the local network
  that is only exploitable if a non-default feature like UPnP is enabled
  ([CVE-2015-20111](/en/2024/07/03/disclose_upnp_rce/)).
* A peer could hinder block propagation by sending mutated blocks, delaying the
  reception of new blocks for a node
  ([CVE-2024-52921](/en/2024/10/08/disclose-mutated-blocks-hindering-propagation/)).
* An attacker announcing a block to a node and then failing to provide it,
  causing the victim node to wait for up to 10 minutes before being able to
  fetch it from another peer
  ([CVE-2024-52922](/en/2024/11/05/cb-stall-hindering-propagation/)).

### Low

Bugs that are challenging to exploit or have a minor impact on a node's
operation. They might only be triggerable under non-default configurations or
from the local network, and do not pose an immediate or widespread threat.

Examples:
* A malformed `getdata` message could cause a peer connection to enter an
  infinite loop, consuming CPU but not affecting the node's ability to process
  blocks or handle other peer connections
  ([CVE-2024-52920](/en/2024/07/03/disclose-getdata-cpu/)).
* A bug in a dependency that could crash a node, but only if a non-default
  feature like UPnP is enabled
  ([CVE-2024-52917](/en/2024/07/31/disclose-upnp-oom/)).
* A bug that could crash a node, but is extremely difficult to exploit
  ([CVE-2024-52919](/en/2025/04/28/disclose-cve-2024-52919/)).

---

**Low** severity bugs will be disclosed 2 weeks after a fixed version exists on the current major release branch.
  A pre-announcement will be made at the same time as the release.

**Medium** and **High** severity bugs will be disclosed 2 weeks after the [last
  affected release goes EOL](/en/lifecycle/). This is a year after a fixed version was first
  released. A pre-announcement will be made 2 weeks prior to disclosure.

**Critical** bugs are not considered in the standard policy, as they would most likely require an
  ad-hoc procedure. Also, a bug may not be considered a vulnerability at all. Any reported issue
  may also be considered serious, yet not require embargo.
