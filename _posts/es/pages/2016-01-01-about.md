Bitcoin Core is an [open source](https://opensource.org/) project which maintains and releases Bitcoin client software called "Bitcoin Core".

It is a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the famous [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Bitcoin Core consists of both "full-node" software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet. The project also currently maintains related
software such as the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1) and others located at [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin).

Anyone can [contribute to Bitcoin Core](/es/contribute/).
