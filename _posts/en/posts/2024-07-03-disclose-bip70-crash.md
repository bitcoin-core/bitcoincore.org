  The BIP70 implementation in Bitcoin-Qt could silently crash when opening a BIP72 URI. A fix was released on June 3rd, 2020 in Bitcoin Core 0.20.0.

Bitcoin-Qt could crash upon opening a [BIP72](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0072.mediawiki) URI.

This issue is considered **Medium** severity.

## Details

[BIP72](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0072.mediawiki) extends the BIP21 URI scheme
with an `r` parameter to fetch a payment request from. An attacker could simply point the URL
contained in the `r` parameter to a very large file, for which Bitcoin-Qt would try to allocate
enough memory and crash.

The victim could get tricked into opening a rogue payment request. The large download would happen
in the background with little to no output in the GUI until the application runs out of memory.
