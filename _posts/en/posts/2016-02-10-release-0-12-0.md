We're very excited to announce the official release of Bitcoin Core v0.12.0. A lot of hard work has gone into this release and it may just be the biggest one yet, with more significant improvements than any other before.

Here are the major improvements you’ll get to benefit from if you upgrade your nodes to version 0.12: 

1. Up to 7x Faster Signature Validation
2. Ability to Limit of Upload Traffic
3. Crash Prevention via Memory Pool Limits
4. Option to Send Transactions That Can Be Fee-Boosted
5. Improved Rules for Transaction Relaying
6. Automatic Usage of Tor When it’s Running
7. Ability for Apps to Subscribe to Notifications With ZeroMQ
8. Massively Reduced Disk Usage for Wallets

In addition to these, there are 13 other improvements that didn’t make the top list but are nonetheless quite valuable. You can find a complete list of them at the end of this post.

Now, let’s go and take a deeper dive into each of these improvements.

## 7x Faster Signature Validation

- ECDSA signatures in Bitcoin transactions are now being validated using libsecp256k1 instead of OpenSSL.
- Validation is now up to 7x faster on 64-bit architecture.
- Raw reindexing and block validation now takes less than half the time it did before.

## Ability to Limit Upload Traffic

- Node upload traffic can be burdensome for some users, so the ability to put limitations on such traffic is a much-needed improvement.
- Node users now have the ability to set soft limits on how much data they upload and serve to their peers.
- Users can set a parameter that specifies how much data the node should target to be served daily.
- It will try not to approach, rather than hit the limit, and after it hits the limit it will only serve blocks requested within the last week.

Crash Prevention via Memory Pool Limits

- Older versions of Bitcoin Software had no limitation on the number of transactions they would allow into their memory pool.
- Even though nodes will only accept transactions that clear a certain specified minimum relay fee, at times the number of transactions that meet those requirements will get arbitrarily large and cause nodes with relatively low RAM to crash.
- Particularly concerning is that attackers can take advantage of this system by flooding the network with transactions in order to crash a subset of nodes.
- With this update, nodes now have default limitations on the size of their memory pools and the operator can configure this to the amount of memory they want to dedicate to the mempool.
- When the memory limit is reached, new transactions can still be accepted, while transactions with the lowest fees will be dropped from the mempool.
- This new memory limitation ensures that unexpected crashes will not happen due to the number of cached transactions getting out of hand.

## Option to Send Transactions That Can Be Fee-Boosted

- Transactions often get stuck if they are have fees that are too low.
- This can cause problems because unspent transactions outputs (UTXOs) that were used in those transactions can be hard to spend, potentially freezing funds.
- Appropriate transaction fees are hard to calculate because they are highly dependent on the volume of transactions and their fees at any given time.
- Thus, one either typically undershoots and gets many stuck transactions or often overshoots, resulting in a massive overpayment and a steady loss of funds.
- A new feature called Opt-in Replace-by-Fee gives transaction senders the option to configure their transactions to be able to be replaced later by other transactions that specify larger fees.
- Senders can start with a low fee and see if their transaction gets picked up, then increase their fee until it gets accepted.
- This allows senders to both minimize the fees they pay and maximize the chance that their transactions will be included in a block.

## Improved Rules for Transaction Relaying

- Up until now, a certain amount of relaying bandwidth has been reserved for transactions with low to zero fees (also known as “free” transactions).
- The issue with this setup is that all other transactions (those with moderately low to high fees) have to fight for less available relaying space.
- To better serve transaction senders, nodes will no longer be guaranteed to relay a certain number of free transactions and will now be able to decide more freely which transactions to relay.

## Automatic Usage of Tor When it’s Running

- Nodes will now detect whether Tor is running and if it is they will automatically create Tor hidden services and connect to other nodes through the Tor network. No manual configuration is required.

## Ability for Apps to Subscribe to Notifications With ZeroMQ

- Up until now there has been limited support for external services to subscribe to notifications about the arrival of new blocks and incoming transactions.
- Services now have this ability thanks to an integration with ZeroMQ.

## Massively Reduced Disk Usage for Wallets

- Users of the Bitcoin Core wallet often feel the burden of the high data storage requirements that come with running a full node (which is now up to 60GB and continues to rise).
- For users who have limitations on storage capacity and still want to use a wallet with a full node, they now have the ability to run their wallet in pruned mode.
- This means that the node will only focus on keeping track of unspent outputs and will forget previously-processed blocks as well as outputs that have been spent.
- This in turn means users will be able to run a full node while only storing around 2GB of data, a massive jump from the previously-required 60GB.
