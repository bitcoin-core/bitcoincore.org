An attacker could prevent a node from seeing a specific unconfirmed transaction.

This issue is considered **Medium** severity.

## Details

Before this issue was fixed in PR 19988, the "g_already_asked_for" mechanism was used to schedule `GETDATA` requests for transactions. The `SendMessages()` function would send out `GETDATA`s for transactions recently announced by peers, remembering when that request was sent out in `g_already_asked_for`. However, this `g_already_asked_for` was a "limitedmap" data structure, with a bounded size that would forget the oldest entries if it reaches 50000 entries. This makes the following attack possible:
* The attacker is the first to announce a legitimate transaction T to the victim.
* The victim requests T from the attacker using `GETDATA`.
* The attacker does not respond to `GETDATA` until close to the time when the victim would request T from other peers (~60 seconds).
* Then, the attacker carefully spams the victim with bogus announcements, causing the victim's `g_already_asked_for` to evict T.
* The attacker announces T again to the victim (due to how the queueing works in `m_tx_process_time`, this does not need to be timed particularly accurately).
* The victim, not finding T in `g_already_asked_for` will treat it as a new announcement, sending a new `GETDATA` for it to the attacker.
* The attacker again does not respond to `GETDATA`.
* etc.

This way, the attacker can prevent the victim from ever requesting the transaction from anyone but the attacker.
