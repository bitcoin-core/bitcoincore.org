The bitcoincore.org website is the official website for the Bitcoin Core project. Other sites may also host information about Bitcoin Core, but they are not under the control of the Bitcoin Core project. We know that the Bitcoin ecosystem can be confusing, and we are working hard to make these relationships more clear.

For development work, Bitcoin Core mainly uses the `#bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel on Freenode, [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [the bitcoin-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/). We also recently created a community Slack group (request an invitation [here](https://slack.bitcoincore.org)) to enable the greater Bitcoin community to connect with Bitcoin Core developers and contributors more easily.

While there are many forums in which the Bitcoin community and, indeed, Bitcoin Core contributors engage, Bitcoin Core is not responsible for those forums, nor does the Bitcoin Core take official positions on the community's decisions to use them. Still, we believe it is critical that the Bitcoin community be able to freely, openly, and civilly discuss and critique any and all changes to the system, no matter their desired forum.

The Bitcoin community can become extremely excited and heated when discussing Bitcoin, but we must all work to maintain a civil tone. Community members should not engage in brigading, denial-of-service attacks, or otherwise disrupt healthy discussion and we should all do our best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise.
