  Nodes would allocate up to 50 MB of memory per attacker sending a malicious `INV` message. A fix was released on June 3rd, 2020 in Bitcoin Core 0.20.0.
---

A node could be forced to allocate a significant amount of memory upon receiving a specially crafted
`INV` message. This was particularly an issue for nodes with little available memory or a large
number of connections.

This issue is considered **Medium** severity.

## Details

An `INV` message filled with 50,000 block items could cause 50,000 `getheaders` responses to be sent
in a single `ProcessMessages()` call. Each response contains a locator and is around 1 kB. All would
be put into the send buffer at once. The attacker could just refuse to receive data to prevent the
50 MB buffer from draining.

John Newbery opened [PR #18962](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18962) to fix this issue
pretexting a bandwidth gain from sending a single `GETHEADERS` per received `INV`.
