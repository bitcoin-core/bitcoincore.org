about1: >
  The Bitcoin Core project provides software that helps you use Bitcoin.
  Its flagship program is a full node that finds the valid chain
  of blocks with the most Proof-of-Work (PoW).  The users of Bitcoin
  Core only accept transactions on that chain, making it the Bitcoin
  block chain that everyone else wants to use.

about2: >
  It is these users who keep Bitcoin decentralized. They
  individually run their own Bitcoin Core full nodes, and each of
  those full nodes separately follows the exact same rules to decide
  which block chain is valid.

about3: >
  There's no voting or other corruptible process involved: there's
  just individual software following identical rules to evaluate
  identical blocks and coming to identical conclusions about which block
  chain is valid.

about4: >
  This shared agreement (called consensus) allows people like you to
  only accept valid bitcoins, enforcing Bitcoin's rules without
  any dependency on centralized authorities.

about5: >
  In addition to improving Bitcoin's decentralization, Bitcoin Core
  users get better security for their bitcoins, privacy features not
  available in other wallets, a choice of user interfaces, and
  several other powerful features.
