The Bitcoin Core project has a large open source developer community with many casual contributors to the codebase.
There are many more who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation.

This page list some of the more full time contributors to the project, as well as those who have some administrative roles.

### Maintainers
      
Project maintainers are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They perform a janitorial role merging patches that the team agrees should be merged. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. The maintainers' role is by agreement of project contributors.
