pgp_key_fingerprint: "PGP key fingerprint"

macos_instructions: "MacOS verification instructions"
linux_instructions: "Linux verification instructions"
snap_instructions: "Snap package verification instructions"
download_release: "Click the link in the list above to download the release for your platform and wait for the file to finish downloading."
download_checksums: "Download the list of cryptographic checksums:"
cd_to_downloads: "Open a terminal (command line prompt) and Change Directory (cd) to the folder you use for downloads.  For example:"
cd_example_linux: "cd Downloads/"
cd_example_windows: >
  cd %UserProfile%\Downloads

verify_download_checksum: "Verify that the checksum of the release file is listed in the checksums file using the following command:"
checksum_warning_and_ok: 'In the output produced by the above command, you can safely ignore any warnings and failures, but you must ensure the output lists "$(SHASUMS_OK)" after the name of the release file you downloaded.  For example:'
obtain_release_key: "Obtain a copy of the release signing key by running the following command:"
release_key_obtained: "The output of the command above should say that one key was imported, updated, has new signatures, or remained unchanged."
verify_checksums_file: "Verify that the checksums file is PGP signed by the release signing key:"
check_gpg_output: "Check the output from the above command for the following text:"
line_starts_with: "A line that starts with:"
complete_line_saying: "A complete line saying:"
gpg_trust_warning: >
  The output from the verify command may contain a warning that
  the "key is not certified with a trusted signature." This means that
  to fully verify your download, you need to ask people you trust to
  confirm that the key fingerprint printed above belongs to the Bitcoin
  Core Project's release signing key.

localized_checksum_ok: "OK"
localized_gpg_good_sig: "Good signature"
localized_gpg_primary_fingerprint: "Primary key fingerprint:"

install_gpg: "If you haven't previously installed GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) on your system,"
gpg_download_page: "install it now"
gpg_download_other: "or see other installation"
gpg_download_options: "options."

snap_warning: >
  While the Snap packages use the deterministically generated executables, the
  Snap tool itself does not provide a streamlined way to reveal the contents of
  a Snap package. Thus, the Bitcoin Core project does not have the information
  necessary to help you verify the Bitcoin Core Snap packages.

ensure_checksum_matches: >
  Ensure that the checksum produced by the command above matches one of
  the checksums listed in the checksums file you downloaded earlier.  We
  recommend that you check every character of the two checksums to
  ensure they match.  You can see the checksums you downloaded by
  running the following command:

generate_checksum: "Run the following command to generate a checksum of the release file you downloaded.  Replace '$(FILE)' with the name of the file you actually downloaded."

build_reproduction: "Additional verification with reproducible builds"
additional_steps: >
  Experienced users who don't mind performing additional steps can take
  advantage of Bitcoin Core's reproducible builds and the signed
  checksums generated by contributors who perform those builds.

reproducible_builds: "Reproducible builds"
build_identical_binaries: >
  allow anyone with a copy of Bitcoin Core's MIT-licensed source code to
  build identical binaries to those distributed on this website (meaning
  the binaries will have the same cryptographic checksums as those
  provided by this website).

verified_reproduction: "Verified reproduction"
independently_reproducing: >
  is the result of multiple Bitcoin Core contributors each independently
  reproducing identical binaries as described above.  These contributors
  cryptographically sign and publish the checksums of the binaries they
  generate.
verifying_and_reproducing: >
  Verifying that several contributors you trust all signed the same
  checksums distributed in the release checksums file will provide you
  with additional assurances over the preceding basic verification
  instructions.  Alternatively, reproducing a binary for yourself will
  provide you with the highest level of assurance currently available.
