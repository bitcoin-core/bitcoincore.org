verification_recommended: >
  <p>Download verification is optional but highly recommended. Performing the
  verification steps here ensures that you have not downloaded an unexpected or
  tampered version of Bitcoin, which may result in loss of funds.</p> 

  <p>Click one of the lines below to view verification instructions for that
  platform.</p>

windows_instructions: "Windows verification instructions"
macos_instructions: "MacOS verification instructions"
linux_instructions: "Linux verification instructions"
snap_instructions: "Snap package verification instructions"
download_release: "Click the link in the list above to download the release for your platform and wait for the file to finish downloading."
download_checksums: "Download the list of cryptographic checksums:"
download_checksums_sigs: "Download the signatures attesting to validity of the checksums:"
cd_to_downloads: "Open a terminal (command line prompt) and Change Directory (cd) to the folder you use for downloads.  For example:"
cd_example_linux: "cd Downloads/"
cd_example_windows: >
  cd %UserProfile%\Downloads

verify_download_checksum: "Verify that the checksum of the release file is listed in the checksums file using the following command:"
checksum_warning_and_ok: 'In the output produced by the above command ensure the output lists "$(SHASUMS_OK)" after the name of the release file you downloaded.  For example:'

example_builders_line: "E777299FC265DD04793070EB944D35F9AC3DB76A Michael Ford (fanquake)"
builder_keys_url: "https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tree/main/builder-keys"
example_builder_key_file: "fanquake.gpg"

obtain_release_key: >
  <p>Bitcoin releases are signed by a number of individuals, each with a unique public
  key. In order to recognize the validity of signatures, you must use GPG to load these
  public keys locally. You can find many developer keys listed in the <a
  href='$(BUILDER_KEYS_URL)'>bitcoin-core/guix.sigs repository</a>, which you can then load
  into your GPG key database.</p>

  <p>For example, you could load the key <a
  href='$(BUILDER_KEYS_URL)/$(EXAMPLE_BUILDER_KEY_FILE)'><code>
  builder-keys/$(EXAMPLE_BUILDER_KEY_FILE)</code></a> by downloading the file as <code>
  $(EXAMPLE_BUILDER_KEY_FILE)</code> and using this command:</p>

choosing_builders: >
  It is recommended that you choose a few individuals from this list who you find
  trustworthy and import their keys as above. You will later use their keys to
  check the signature attesting to the validity of the checksums you use to check
  the binaries. You can import all keys at once by cloning the repo and importing the directory:

release_key_obtained: "The output of the command above should say that one key was imported, updated, has new signatures, or remained unchanged."

verify_checksums_file: "Verify that the checksums file is PGP signed by a sufficient amount of keys you trust and have imported into your keychain:"

check_gpg_output: >
  The command above will output a series of signature checks for each of the public
  keys that signed the checksums. Each valid signature will show the following text:

line_starts_with: "A line that starts with:"
complete_line_saying: "A complete line saying:"

gpg_trust_warning: >
  The output from the verify command may contain warnings that a public key is not available.
  As long as you have all the public keys of signers you trust, this warning can
  be disregarded. There may be additional warnings that a "key is not
  certified with a trusted signature." This means that to fully verify your download,
  you need to confirm that the signing key's fingerprint (e.g.
  <code>$(SHORT_BUILDER_KEY)</code>) listed in the second line above matches what
  you had expected for the signers public key.

verify_keys: "See the GNU handbook section on key management for more details."

localized_checksum_ok: "OK"
localized_gpg_good_sig: "Good signature"
localized_gpg_primary_fingerprint: "Primary key fingerprint:"

install_gpg: "If you haven't previously installed GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) on your system,"
gpg_download_page: "install it now"
gpg_download_other: "or see other installation"
gpg_download_options: "options."

snap_warning: >
  While the Snap packages use the deterministically generated executables, the
  Snap tool itself does not provide a streamlined way to reveal the contents of
  a Snap package. Thus, the Bitcoin Core project does not have the information
  necessary to help you verify the Bitcoin Core Snap packages.

ensure_checksum_matches: >
  Ensure that the checksum produced by the command above matches one of
  the checksums listed in the checksums file you downloaded earlier.  We
  recommend that you check every character of the two checksums to
  ensure they match.  You can see the checksums you downloaded by
  running the following command:

generate_checksum: "Run the following command to generate a checksum of the release file you downloaded.  Replace '$(FILE)' with the name of the file you actually downloaded."

build_reproduction: "Additional verification with reproducible builds"
additional_steps: >
  Experienced users who don't mind performing additional steps can take
  advantage of Bitcoin Core's reproducible builds and the signed
  checksums generated by contributors who perform those builds.

reproducible_builds: "Reproducible builds"
build_identical_binaries: >
  allow anyone with a copy of Bitcoin Core's MIT-licensed source code to
  build identical binaries to those distributed on this website (meaning
  the binaries will have the same cryptographic checksums as those
  provided by this website).

verified_reproduction: "Verified reproduction"
independently_reproducing: >
  is the result of multiple Bitcoin Core contributors each independently
  reproducing identical binaries as described above.  These contributors
  cryptographically sign and publish the checksums of the binaries they
  generate.
verifying_and_reproducing: >
  The preceding verification instructions will verify that several 
  contributors you trust all signed the same checksums distributed in 
  the release checksums file. Additionally, reproducing a binary for 
  yourself will provide you with the highest level of assurance currently
  available. For more information, visit the project's repository of
guix_repository: "trusted build process signatures"
