## Introduction

By visiting this website or are otherwise providing your personal information to us via any other means, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Policy. Unless specified otherwise, the term “visitor” includes everyone whether you upload information to our website, download information, or are merely visiting.

This privacy policy will govern our use of your information, regardless of what information we collect.

## What information do we collect?

We collect basic usage information in the form of logs from all visitors. When you visit our website, our server logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, and the time and duration of the pages on our website you view. We may also capture information about your computer system, such as your browser type and operating system.

We will likely place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on your computer, then they can be disabled in your web browser. However, please note that disabling cookies in your browser may prevent this website from working correctly. We may use third party DDOS protection services and they may also use cookies to deliver their services.

## What do we use this information for?

Basic usage information. We use basic usage information to monitor and improve the availability, performance and content of this website.

Personally identifiable information. We may use the information we collect to improve the content of the website. We may use this information to prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our websites and to enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.  

## Disclosure of personal information

We will not disclose any information we collect to any third party unless it is:

- Specifically authorized by you; or
- Necessary to perform the functions requested by you (and only to the extent absolutely necessary to perform the function); or
- Required to check for fraud or other misuse of resources; or
- Required by law.

In particular, we may release the information we collect to third parties when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our legal rights, to protect the rights and safety of others, or to assist with industry efforts to control fraud, spam or other undesirable conduct.

If we contract with a third party to provide a particular service, we may release the information we collect to that third party, provided that the third party has agreed to use at least the same level of privacy protections described in this Privacy Policy, and is permitted to use the information only for the purpose of providing services to us.  

## Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and the new policy will be posted prominently on this website. We will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past without your prior consent.
