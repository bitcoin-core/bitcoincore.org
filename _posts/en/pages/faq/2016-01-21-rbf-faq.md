## What is opt-in RBF?

During the period when transactions are waiting to be added to a block,
some wallets would like to be able to update those transactions in order
to increase their fee (which may help them get confirmed faster), add
new outputs (possibly compressing what would be multiple transactions
into a single transaction), create background coinjoins (to improve
privacy), or to perform a number of other useful actions.

Opt-in Replace-by-Fee (RBF) is a change to memory pool and network relay
code that allows those wallets to optionally add a signal to their
transactions which tells full nodes that those particular transactions
may be updated (replaced) up until the point that they get confirmed in
a new block.

## Does the opt-in RBF implementation change the likelihood that a "non-RBF" transaction can be double-spent?

No.  A transaction must be marked replaceable (sequence number *below* MAX*-1*)
in order for the opt-in RBF implementation to treat it as replaceable.

## Does opt-in RBF make fraudulent spends significantly more successful?

Opt-in RBF has no effect on transactions which are not using it and no one is forced to use it. It has no effect once a transaction has been confirmed. This means that users who care about unconfirmed transaction can continue to not use RBF.

## Are opt-in transactions themselves more useful tools to dedicated fraudsters, assuming people accept them without confirmation?

We currently do not have reason to believe that they are, at least not significantly, against fraudsters using the most effective tools and practices known. But if they are (or until it is more clear that they are not) recipients can protect themselves by continuing to regard transactions with non-max sequence numbers as unsafe until they become confirmed.

Because spenders who use opt-in RBF have the ability to increase their
fees and possibly reduce their confirmation time even when there are
many transactions waiting to confirm, it's not inconsiderate to
require that their transactions be confirmed before providing them
with services.

## Why aren't unconfirmed transactions safe?

Bitcoin transactions are relayed across an asynchronous distributed
system where there is no such thing as a globally consistent "first".
What Alice saw first, Bob might see second.  The Bitcoin design
doesn't provide a mechanism for Alice and Bob to come to agreement about
which of those transactions really came first; all they can do is wait
to see which of those transactions gets confirmed in a valid block on
the best block chain.

Sophisticated double spending attackers today use tools to map the
network connectivity by making harmless looking conflicting spends and
seeing which versions show up at which merchants and in which blocks.
This allows them to craft two versions of the same transaction, one
which they send to their victim and one which they send to miners for
confirmation.

The presence of the non-replaceable payment to the merchant prevents his
node from learning about the a double-spend until it shows up in a block
mined by a miner that was merely mining the thing they saw first. This
simple, common pattern is sometimes further amplified by additional
techniques such as using unconfirmed transaction chains, low fees, or
non-standard transactions.

As a result, the vast majority of the security for unconfirmed
transactions comes not from within the Bitcoin system, but from external
factors such as the large numbers of honest Bitcoin users who would
never attempt to defraud their vendors, the tolerance among vendors for
small amounts of fraud, the ability (or threat) of vendors resorting to
the legal system or other types of recourse, and other factors which
have nothing to do with the design of the Bitcoin protocol.

All of these things hold equally true for opt-in RBF (and they're not
unlike the situation with credit card payments in the US, which are
easily reversable for months after the exchange and yet which have fraud
rates low enough that almost all significant merchants accept them).
Also, because RBF can sometimes eliminate long confirmation delays, some
merchants which previously felt forced to accept unconfirmed transactions
to prevent unfortunate delays will no longer need to do so, which reduces
their exposure to fraud.

However, no one using opt-in RBF is insisting that you agree with the
above view on unconfirmed transaction security. Opt-in RBF is *opt-in*,
and if it doesn't fit your needs you are not required to use it.

## Who invented unconfirmed transaction replacement? Does it go against the "vision" of Bitcoin?

Transaction replacement for unconfirmed transactions was [a feature in the very first release of Bitcoin](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L434).  Transactions could mark themselves as replaceable by setting a non-maximal sequence number. This was later disabled because it was possible
for an attacker to use up all the bandwidth among full nodes at only a
small cost to himself, creating a denial-of-service vulnerability.

In addition, there was no incentive for miners to follow the convention
and accept a replacement, and there could even be an incentive to
violate the convention if an earlier version of a transaction paid a
higher fee.

These two factors kept replacement from being restored for several
years, but in 2013 Peter Todd
[proposed](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=199947.0) requiring
replacements to pay a strictly greater fee rate and to require that the
replacement increase the fee rate by at least the minimum required to
relay a new transaction. This eliminated both the denial of service and
incentive compatibility problems.

Peter's original work went further and carried the incentive
compatibility to its logical conclusion, reasoning that with anonymous,
ephemeral, self-selecting miners the only behavior you can really count
on is replacement with higher fees. Higher fee preference can also make
it possible for nodes to converge on a set of transactions in the memory
pool based on fee rate in a way that isn't possible for nodes which only
accept the first version of a transaction that they see.

Because of these reasons and because the system behaving in expected
ways is more secure and protective than the system behaving in
"unpredictable but better on average ways", he proposed making
replacement happen for all transactions. He also proposed a protocol
to remove economic gains from double spending in a strong incentive
compatible way, called replacement scorched earth, where if someone
attempts to double spend you, you spend all the funds to fees so the
attacker doesn't get them.  (But this is the kind of proposal only a
game theorist could really love.)

After Peter's proposal, we heard a number of wallets call very strongly
for opt-in RBF, as they really needed a reasonable way to handle fees
and saw opt-in RBF as a good way to do so which is why the proposal was
changed to match Satoshi's original opt-in behavior.

## Was the opt-in RBF pull request controversial?

Not in the slightest. After extensive informal discussion stemming back
months, the [PR][RBF PR] was opened on October 22nd. It was subsequently
discussed in at least four Bitcoin development weekly meetings
([2015-11-05][], [2015-11-12][], [2015-11-19][], and [2015-11-26][]).

[RBF PR]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6871
[2015-11-05]: /en/meetings/2015/11/05/
[2015-11-12]: /en/meetings/2015/11/12/
[2015-11-19]: /en/meetings/2015/11/19/
[2015-11-26]: /en/meetings/2015/11/26/

In the PR discussion, 19 people commented (including people working on at least three different wallet brands) and 14 people explicitly ACKed the change, including at least one person who had been very outspoken in the past against full RBF.  No clearly negative feedback was provided in the PR (or elsewhere that we are aware of) while the PR was open.

## When and how does this change get activated?

Opt-in RBF doesn't really have an "activation" because it's not a part of Bitcoin's consensus. It's a local policy behavior and so the change happens one node at a time as people adopt software that behaves differently.  There are already some nodes on the network which perform RBF in various ways and there have been for some time, probably years.

Bitcoin Core 0.12 will be released around February 2016 and will include opt-in RBF, and after that it will likely take a couple additional months before the behavior is commonplace. This may be sped up by the development of applications that make interesting use of it.

## Is opt-in RBF only useful for adjusting fees?

No, opt-in RBF can also be used to make slow-to-confirm transactions much more efficient by revising them to pay multiple people when the sender finds they have more people to pay and their last payment hasn't confirmed yet, or when they find they need to increase the payment amount for a person they are already paying. This also lets transaction authors avoid spending unconfirmed change, which is currently vulnerable to third-party malleability.

Opt-in RBF can also be used to implement more advanced cooperative stability schemes such as [transaction cut-through](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=281848.0).

Various [smart contract](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0) cases also need replacement, but they usually use locktime to create stronger ordering and work around the historic unavailability of replacement; these were presumably the motivation for supporting replacement in the Bitcoin protocol in its original design.

Although interesting for more reasons than just adjusting fees, the
ability to adjust fees should not be understated. It means that the
initial fee can use a lower "most likely" estimate instead of having to
over-pay "just in case"; this results in lower fees even when replacements
are rarely made.

## Would a wallet need to stay online to issue replacements with higher fees?

No. Replacements can be pre-computed, time locked, and given to an
always-online remote server for later broadcast with no risk that the
server could steal any user funds (at worst it could fail to broadcast).

For example. At block 100 a wallet wants to make a transaction set to confirm within 3 blocks. The wallet authors a transaction locked at 101 with its best estimate of a three block confirmation fee, at the same time it also authors replacement transactions locktimed for heights 104, 105, 106, 107... each paying (say) 1.5x the fee of the last. These can be handed to a node that accepts advanced locktime transactions.

Even if miners know higher fees will be paid in the future, rationally they still prefer the one they can include now---since, if they wait, another miner will likely take the fees. The multiplicative increase suggested above means that, at worst, a transaction would overpay by 50%, but can still reach arbitrarily high fees in few transactions.

## Does opt-in RBF increase the risk that "lazy" transaction processors will get scammed?

It doesn't appear to be so, at least not significantly and this is by
design. Opt-In RBF is signaled using the nSequence field, a field that
is specifically intended to cover replaceability. Many programs and
platforms that trust unconfirmed transactions in general already regard
low sequence numbered transactions as suspect and ignore them until
they confirm.

There are dozens of other ways that transactions can change their speed
or reliability of confirmation and increase the probability of a
successful fraudulent double spend:

- paying low fee
- using non-standard flags or versions
- spending unconfirmed inputs
- behaving like any number of denial-of-service attack patterns
- creating dust txouts
- etc.

These criteria are frequently changing and depend on node specific
policy that is configurable by users. Parties attempting to estimate the
risk of an unconfirmed payment must track all these things and more, and
they must be proactive in responding to changes. Opt-in RBF is a highly
communicated addition known months in advance that overlays on already
detected behavior. If there is any change in the efforts required for
unconfirmed transaction vigilance, it's likely in the noise.

Beyond that, it's unclear that an opt-in RBF transactions will actually
be significantly more useful for fraudulent double spending than non-RBF
ones, at least when used by attackers with sophisticated tools.

Some parties that perform unconfirmed confidence analysis have clearly
indicated that [they're ready for it][blockcypher ready], and if anyone
is aware of software that still needs help adapting, let us know and we'd
be glad to help.

## What if I think that RBF is just awful?

Then don't use it: don't set it on your own transactions and treat transactions you receive with all sequence numbers less
than MAX_INT-1 as non-existing (or already double-spent) until they confirm. Opt-in RBF is opt-in.

No commonly used software that we're aware of sets its sequence numbers to below MAX_INT-1, and many programs (including "transaction confidence" meters) already regard low sequence numbers as potentially double spendable. After all, the transaction has been explicitly marked as replaceable, and even without RBF, nLocktime may result in a conflict getting confirmed first.

If someone sends you a replaceable transaction and you won't zero-conf credit it, their replacement can make it get confirmed as fast as they want it to get confirmed. The same sorts of situations exist already for senders using non-standard transaction features or spending unconfirmed outputs, which makes transactions objectively more double spendable---but in those cases there is no fix to get the transaction through quickly.

RBF is a feature for consenting adults. If you don't want to participate in it, you don't need to. Your dislike of it isn't a reason to prevent others from using it in transactions that don't involve you.

## Why implement 'opt-in' and not just let miners replace any transaction?

Nothing stops miners from replacing even non-opt-in transactions right now,
and some miners have previously experimented with RBF on their own.  By
providing a standard implementation that can fulfill user demand for
this feature, it's possible there will be less incentive for miners to
begin replacing any transaction with higher fee rate variants.

Satoshi originally introduced [unconfirmed transaction replacement](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L434)
but this was disabled due to a DOS attack (which Peter Todd fixed by requiring a higher fee for each replacement).

## Can this be used to double spend against unprepared (old) wallets? Will all wallets have to update?

Unconfirmed transactions can always be double spent, with or without RBF. Fraud
is currently easy, and RBF doesn't change that.

Wallets only have to update if they want to make use of opt-in RBF. This
gives wallets a new dimension along which they can innovate and provide
beneficial features to users.

## Why not First-seen-safe Replace-by-fee (FSS-RBF)

FSS-RBF means that transactions can only be modified if all previous
outputs are fully spent. This prevents double spends, but it has three
problems when it actually gets used:

1. It results in increased transaction size because you must add a new
   input to each replacement.

2. Many wallets don't have spare inputs to spend, so they simply can't
   use FSS-RBF.

2. It reduces privacy because it almost always increases the value of
   the change output, publicly marking that output as change.

## What is "Child pays for parent" (CPFP)?

Child pays for parent is a way of adding fees to a transaction by making an another transaction that depends on the first.

## Why wasn't CPFP used for RBF?

Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) doesn't solve the same problem.  RBF allows
the *spender* to increase fees; CPFP is useful because it allows the
*recipient* to increase fees.

RBF has the advantage over CPFP that it doesn't necessarily require
using any extra block space, so it's more efficient by about [30% to
90%](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008232.html).

The plan is to support both CPFP and opt-in RBF.
