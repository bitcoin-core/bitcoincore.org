## last-minute merges before feature freeze 0.14

### background

Bitcoin Core 0.14 is [scheduled][#8719] to be released around March 2017. Open pull request aimed for 0.14 are [tagged with a 0.14 tag](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A0.14.0).

### meeting comments

[#9535][] (Split CNode::cs_vSend: message processing and message sending) got some thorough review and would be a great win.

[#9461][] (Improve progress display) is ready and [#9294][] (HD split) needs another review. It has string changes, so it needs to be done before the feature freeze to allow for translations.

Gmaxwell thinks [#9526][] (-blocksonly should disable sharing of mempool with dbcache) should be untagged for 0.14. BlueMatt and Sipa think it's a bugfix and therefor can be merged after the feature freeze.

Priority for 0.14 is solving the nasty remaining issues, like the [wallet sync problems][#9584].

BlueMatt noticed [#9108][] (Use importmulti timestamp when importing watch only keys) needs a 0.14 tag, as it fixes issue [#9034][] which is tagged for 0.14.

BlueMatt is fine with untagging [#9027][] (Unbounded reorg memory usage) for 0.14. It was pointed out we can do a simple fix to address the issue, but there's other issues making it non-trivial to fix it completely.

### meeting conclusion

- Review [#9294][] (Use internal HD chain for change outputs (hd split))

## wallet synchronization issues

### background

Since [#7946][] Bitcoin Core doesn't hold cs_main while syncing transactions connected in a block with the wallet. There have been several issues of which at least 2 remain, summarized in issue [#9584][].

### meeting comments

BlueMatt tried to [fix][#9570] issue [#9148][], but it turned out to be more complicated than anticipated. He recommends [#9583][] (Move wallet callbacks into cs_main (this effectively reverts [#7946][])) for 0.14, and do a set of bigger changes for 0.15. His intend for 0.15 is to move these callbacks into a background thread.

### meeting conclusion

- Review [#9583][] as solution for 0.14

## Final alert for 0.14

### background

The bitcoin alert system was a way for trusted parties to broadcast a message to all Core clients about critical network problems. It has been removed in Bitcoin Core since 0.13.0 and has been disabled for a while now.

The final step in the retirement of the alert system is to hardcode nodes to send the [final alert](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement) to peers to overcome the lack of propagation.

### meeting comments

Now is as good a time as any to send the final alert. Given the prior alert there's no need for delays or announcements.

### meeting conclusion

- Send final alert message (PR [#9594][])
