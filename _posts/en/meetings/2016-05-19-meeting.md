## Main topics
 
- Versionbits GetBlockTemplate and CSV activation

## Notes / short topics

- This was a short meeting with low attendance because a lot of developers where traveling to the [coredev hacking event](http://coredev.tech/).
- Luke-jr wonders if someone has looked at the latest OpenSSL exploits. When releasing 0.12.2 it might makes sense to bump OpenSSL with it.

## Versionbits GetBlockTemplate and CSV activation
 
### background
 
Getblocktemplate is the new decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol, openly developed by the Bitcoin community over mid 2012. It supersedes the old getwork mining protocol. ([Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate)-link)

CheckSequenceVerify or [BIP112][] is one of the time-lock related BIPs released in 0.12.1 which is the first softfork that should activate with [BIP9][] versionbits.
 
### meeting comments
 
Luke-jr mentions he needs [GBT support][#7935] for the Eligius mining pool. There are some applications that want CSV and it would be nice to not have both CSV and segwit activate at the same time, so while not critical it would be nice if it could be activated within a decent timeframe. backports to 0.11 or 0.12 CPFP testing/review would get the Eligius on board with CSV.

### meeting conclusion

Review PR [#7600][] which implements "Child-Pays-For-Parent".
