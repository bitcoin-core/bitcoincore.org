## Notes / short topics

- Jonasschnelli created a draft video for the 2016 Git visualization.

## Main topics

-  fork warning system repair
-  0.14 review priorities

##  fork warning system repair

### background

The large-work fork warning system, which should warn users if a fork with enough proof-of-work continues to be mined, is currently broken under header first validation.

Jl2012 is [working][#9443] on a fix for this.

### meeting comments

Jl2012 elaborates this is more than a fix, in that it stores valid headers under an invalid block as long as there's valid PoW and valid nTime.

Gmaxwell has doubts about the utility of the warning system: there's been too many false warnings and it wasn't used usefully by most to begin with. BlueMatt notes having a reliable warning system is the first step towards fixing the trust in the system.

Sipa wonders if we need a detection of internal consensus errors like database corruption, CPU overheating, etc., because 99.99% of all fork warnings that are seen in practice are just broken nodes.

No one is making the argument for this change to be important for 0.14

### meeting conclusion

- Focus more on the 0.14 critical changes

## 0.14 review priorities

### background

Bitcoin Core 0.14 is [scheduled](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8719) to be released around March 2017. Open pull request aimed for 0.14 are [tagged with a 0.14 tag](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A0.14.0).

### meeting comments

Things people would like to see in 0.14 if review effort wasn't a bottleneck:

Wumpus would like to see [named arguments][#8811].

BlueMatt thinks [parallel ProcessMessages][#9488] would be a huge improvement for some use cases, but if there's not enough time to review it he'll skip it for 0.14.

Jtimon hopes to get [custom blockchains][#8994] in, but wonders how realistic that is. For efficiency [this optimization][#8498] might help, but nobody has found time to benchmark it.

Luke-jr notes there was some desire for the multiwallet PR's ([#8775][] and [#8694][]), and [ignore/override rejections][#7533] but they're not tagged with the 0.14 milestone.

Morcos would like to see the block relay improvements ([#9375][], [#9441][] and [#9447][]) and possibly [parallel ProcessMessages][#9488] going in. [#9441][] has a lot of commits, but most of them are very tiny to make review easier.

Gmaxwell was hoping to see the multiwallet support go in (PR's [#8775][] and [#8694][]) and the [UTXO scriptpubkey index][#8660], although the latter looks to be abandoned by its requester. Also the [CreateTransaction change][#9404] from Morcos which fixes some concerning fee overpayment corner case would be nice.

Jonasschnelli thinks [HD chain split][#9294] should also go into 0.14, plus some form of HD rescan.

There's already a lot of stuff to do, and there's at least 4 regressions which are 0.14-blocking (issues [#9479][], [#9027][], [#9148][] and [#9212][]). Morcos notes if [#9371][] (fixing issue [#9479][]) won't make it in 0.14 we need to revert [#9240][].

### meeting conclusion

- Focus on fee fixes ([#9404][]), net locks overhaul ([#9441][]), named arguments ([#8811][]),early compact block relay ([#9375][], [#9441][] and [#9447][]) and in lower priority the multiwallet changes ([#8775][] and [#8694][]).
