## Notes / short topics

Gmaxwell notes he'd still like to see separate testnet-defaulting binaries during the RC's. Wumpus points at a [PR][#8285] he missed that makes it very easy to install a testnet client.

## Main topics
 
- 0.13.0 rc1 & HD wallet issue
- FIBRE announcement

## 0.13.0 rc1

### background
 
The Bitcoin Core team is working towards 0.13.0 RC1. ([full schedule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7679))

### meeting comments
 
There's a few [issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/milestone/20) that need to be fixed for 0.13.0. Wumpus can't build a release as gitian lxc building is broken as explained in [this issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8212) (the day after the meeting a [workaround][#8315] was found). For 0.14 we can switch to ubuntu 16.04 which has fixed this issue.

Sdaftuar has some PR's open meant for 0.13.0 which lack some review, namely [#8305][] (headers sync issue), [#8312][] (mempool DoS post-segwit merge) and [#8295][] (mining code fixes post segwit-merge). 

When testing the new hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet MarcoFalke encountered an issue. Either being an error in his [test code][#8309] or an issue with IsMine(). If there's no clear answer why this issue happens it's better to disable the HD wallet for 0.13.

Before the end of the meeting Jonasschnelli already found the bug in the testcode of MarcoFalke. The fixed test will be included in 0.13.0.

### meeting conclusion

- Review [open issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/milestone/20) for 0.13.0 
- Tag sdaftuar's PR's with the 0.13.0 milestone

## FIBRE announcement

### background
 
Matt Corrallo has [announced](http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2016/07/07/relay-networks/) his new relay network work that uses UDP and FEC, the current not really fully cooked software gets worldwide block propagation 99% of the time in less than 100ms over the fiber-path distances.

More info can be found on the website [http://bitcoinfibre.org/](http://bitcoinfibre.org/)

### meeting comments
 
In his deployment he uses only cheap VPS's. He's trying to get other people to setup parallel networks and put up an extensive guide, including tracks for getting access to low latency connectivity between Asia en Europe.

petertodd     wumpus: happy halving day :)
wumpus        hah, same to you
gmaxwell      I wonder if there is some sci-fi where halving day is where half the people die? it seems right.
petertodd     I'll be hiding in a cave most of that day fyi - so if the world ends don't call me :P
petertodd     gmaxwell: Satoshi should have made it a 10% thing, so we could call it DECIMATION DAY
wumpus        petertodd: that sounds like a wise thing to do, hide in a cave until it blows over
